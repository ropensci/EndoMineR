Barretts_PathStage(dataframe, PathColumn)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataframe}{dataframe with column of interest}

\item{PathColumn}{column of interest}
}
\description{
This extracts the pathological stage from the histopathology specimen. It is
done using 'degradation' so that it will look for the worst overall grade
in the histology specimen and if not found it will look for the next worst
and so on. It looks per report not per biopsy (it is more common
for histopathology reports to contain the worst overall grade
rather than individual biopsy grades).
Specfically it extracts the histopathology worst grade within the specimen
FOr the sake of accuracy this should alwats be used after the HistolDx function
and this removes negative sentences such as 'there is no dysplasia'. 
This current function should be used on the column derived from HistolDx
which is called Dx_Simplified
}
\examples{
# Firstly relevant columns are extrapolated from the
# Mypath demo dataset. These functions are all part of Histology data 
# cleaning
# as part of the package.


# The histology is then merged with the Endoscopy dataset. The merge occurs
# according to date and Hospital number
v<-Endomerge2(Myendo,'Dateofprocedure','HospitalNumber',v,'Dateofprocedure',
'HospitalNumber')
# The function then takes the Histology column from the merged data set (v).
# It extracts the worst histological grade for a specimen
nn<-HistolDx(Mypath,'Diagnosis')
b<-Barretts_PathStage(nn,'Dx_Simplified')
rm(v)
